  "chosen_hypothesis_name": "cheap_rotation_proxy_matches_jvp_rotation_measure",
  "rationale": "This hypothesis is exceptionally clear and falsifiable: it reduces to measuring agreement (e.g., correlation/rank correlation) between cheap, optimizer-accessible signals and a more direct rotation diagnostic estimated via JVPs. It is comparatively low-risk and resource-feasible because it can be validated on a small set of standard GAN setups/datasets without extensive hyperparameter sweeps, while still producing broadly useful artifacts (a practical diagnostic) that can underpin a follow-on adaptive optimizer paper. Even partial success (identifying when/where proxies fail) is publishable as it directly addresses a widely felt measurement gap for game dynamics in large neural GANs.",
