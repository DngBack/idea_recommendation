# Title: Advancing Efficient and Scalable Machine Learning

## Keywords
efficient ML, scalable training, model compression, data efficiency

## TL;DR
How can we make modern ML models more efficient, accessible, and sustainable without sacrificing performance?

## Abstract
As machine learning models grow in size and complexity, the computational and environmental costs of training and deploying them continue to rise. This creates a significant barrier for academic labs, smaller companies, and researchers in resource-constrained settings. This topic explores methods and ideas for improving the efficiency and scalability of ML systems across the entire pipeline — from data collection and preprocessing, through training and optimization, to inference and deployment. Key areas of interest include but are not limited to: model compression (pruning, quantization, distillation), efficient architectures (mixture of experts, sparse models), data-efficient learning (few-shot, active learning, curriculum learning), hardware-aware optimization, and sustainable AI practices. We are particularly interested in novel approaches that challenge the prevailing "scale is all you need" paradigm and demonstrate that thoughtful algorithmic design can achieve competitive results with a fraction of the resources. Proposals should be grounded in rigorous experimentation and aim for publication at top ML venues.
