  "rationale": "This hypothesis is the most directly testable with modest engineering: the proposed proxies can be computed from quantities already available during training (gradients, norms, step-to-step changes) without implementing new second-order machinery. It scales well in an academic lab because it can be validated across small-to-mid GANs/datasets with many seeds and controlled perturbations, yielding statistically solid results. If the proxy robustly predicts blow-ups earlier and better than loss-only baselines, it is a clear, publishable contribution as a diagnostic/measurement tool and can serve as a foundation for subsequent adaptive-control methods.",
