        "The proxy may be dominated by gradient noise, batch-to-batch stochasticity, learning-rate schedules, momentum/Adam internal state, or curvature changes, not rotation per se; without controls (fixed data order, large batch, variance decomposition) correlation claims may be spurious.",
        "The rotation “ground truth” is ill-defined: 'Jacobian-imaginary-dominance/rotation indicators' needs a precise, comparable scalar metric; occasional JVPs alone do not directly yield imaginary parts without additional approximations (e.g., estimating skew-symmetric component norms, local cyclicity measures, or eigenvalue estimates) and these approximations must be specified and validated.",
        "The intervention (adaptive damping) is unspecified: what is damped (step size, momentum, discriminator/generator ratio, regularization strength), how triggers are computed (thresholds, smoothing), and how to avoid destabilizing feedback loops are all open.",

      "detailed_review": "At a conceptual level, using consecutive-gradient disagreement as a cheap indicator for non-conservative/rotational behavior in game dynamics is plausible and could be useful. However, the current submission is far from an ICML-ready proposal: it lacks basic experimental specification (which GANs/datasets, which baselines, what stability metrics, how many seeds, what compute budget), contains no related-work positioning, and does not define the key quantities needed to test the central hypothesis. To make this viable, I would expect: (1) a precise definition of the rotation indicator to be estimated from JVPs (e.g., norm of the skew-symmetric part of the Jacobian estimated via Hutchinson, local cyclicity measures, or small-k Arnoldi/Lanczos eigen-estimates) and a discussion of estimator variance/cost; (2) controlled studies on toy games (bilinear, quadratic) where rotation is analytically known, to check whether gradient disagreement tracks rotation vs. noise/curvature; (3) clear GAN benchmarks (e.g., CIFAR-10 with DCGAN/ResNet, possibly ImageNet subsets) with standard reporting (FID/IS, collapse/divergence rate, training oscillation measures) across ≥5–10 seeds; (4) strong baselines that explicitly target rotation/stability (extragradient, optimistic Adam/OMD, consensus optimization / SGA/JARE-like methods, TTUR variants, gradient penalties/spectral norm) plus naive adaptive LR heuristics; and (5) a well-specified damping policy with ablations (thresholding vs. continuous mapping, smoothing windows, per-parameter-group vs. global, interaction with Adam moments). Without these, the proposal is too incomplete and risks producing ambiguous correlations and fragile heuristics rather than a convincing, novel contribution."

      "detailed_review": "This idea could become a solid empirical paper, but in its current form it is too incomplete for acceptance: key components (task, metrics, baselines, precise rotation diagnostic, and the adaptive damping algorithm) are missing. To make it rigorous and reproducible, I recommend: (1) Specify the setting(s): at minimum one canonical min-max benchmark where rotation is well characterized (e.g., bilinear game, convex-concave toy problems) plus one large-scale application (e.g., CIFAR-10/FFHQ GAN training with a fixed architecture such as StyleGAN2-ADA or a standard GAN baseline). (2) Define the “ground-truth” rotation metric: e.g., estimate the Jacobian of the simultaneous gradient field F(θ) and measure imaginary dominance via eigenvalue estimates (Lanczos/Arnoldi with JVP/VJP), or use a scalar proxy like ||(J−J^T)v|| relative to ||Jv|| with random probes; specify probe count, frequency, and overhead. (3) Carefully design the proxy computation: clarify whether g_t is full-batch, mini-batch, per-parameter-group, or per-module; consider using EMA-smoothed gradients to reduce noise; report sensitivity to batch size and data order. (4) Define the intervention: what is “damping” (learning-rate reduction, momentum damping, extra-gradient step, implicit update approximation, added symmetric gradient penalty)? Provide a deterministic mapping from proxy statistic to control action, with hyperparameters and tuning protocol. (5) Baselines: include simple controls (fixed LR, cosine LR decay, gradient clipping, EMA-only), as well as game-optimization baselines where relevant (extragradient, optimistic mirror descent, consensus optimization / symplectic gradient adjustment variants, or other rotation-aware methods). (6) Evaluation: report both stability (loss oscillation metrics, divergence rate, gradient norm blow-ups, number of restarts) and final quality (FID/IS for GANs), plus compute overhead. (7) Ablations: compare disagreement measures (cosine vs sign-flip vs lag-k), window sizes, JVP frequency, threshold schemes, and intervention strength; include negative results and cases where disagreement tracks noise rather than rotation. Without these elements, the current proposal reads as a plausible heuristic but not yet a scientifically grounded or clearly novel contribution."

      "detailed_review": "This is a plausible and potentially useful engineering idea, but it is not yet a research-ready proposal because the core constructs and evaluation are underspecified and the main hypothesis is vulnerable to confounding. As written, I would not assign a full PhD cycle to it, but I would consider a scoped pilot if you tighten the scope to a specific min-max setting (e.g., GAN training with a fixed architecture/optimizer) and define both the rotation metric and the damping intervention precisely.\n\nTo make this feasible with a small team and limited budget, start with controlled testbeds where rotation is known and measurable: bilinear games and small synthetic GANs with full-batch gradients. In these regimes, you can compute or tightly approximate Jacobian spectral properties (e.g., estimating dominant complex eigenpairs via Arnoldi/power iterations using JVPs/VJPs) and quantify whether your proxy tracks (a) imaginary-to-real magnitude ratio, (b) curl/antisymmetric component norms, or (c) cycling metrics in parameter trajectories. Only after establishing a robust relationship under controlled noise should you move to stochastic minibatch training; otherwise you risk concluding “no correlation” due purely to noise/momentum effects.\n\nFor the intervention, specify the control law: what exactly is “adaptive damping” (learning-rate reduction, extra-gradient step, proximal term, increasing real-part regularization, EMA/momentum adjustment, or a consensus/curl penalty)? Pre-register ablations that disentangle \"detect\" vs \"act\" (proxy on/off, true rotation metric on/off, random triggers, fixed-schedule damping). Baselines should include known anti-rotation methods (extragradient/optimistic methods, consensus optimization, lookahead, gradient penalty variants) and simple heuristics (gradient norm spikes, loss spikes) to show your proxy is uniquely informative.\n\nMain risks: (1) the proxy mostly measures gradient noise or optimizer transients rather than rotation; (2) the proxy may correlate but not be causal for instability; (3) damping triggered by the proxy may improve stability but harm speed or final sample quality. Mitigations: use multi-seed experiments, control minibatch size, evaluate with/without momentum, report calibration curves (proxy→instability probability), and measure both stability (divergence rate, NaNs, oscillation amplitude) and final quality (FID/IS) with matched compute budgets. With these revisions, the project becomes a credible 6–10 week study; the current 2–4 week estimate is optimistic unless you restrict to toy/small benchmarks."

The central construct-validity risk is that consecutive-step gradient disagreement is a conflated signal: it rises with stochasticity, optimizer state changes (Adam/momentum), and sharp curvature, not uniquely with rotational/antisymmetric Jacobian components. To make the proxy claim credible, you need (1) a precise definition of the “rotation indicator” (e.g., estimated imaginary part magnitude of dominant eigenvalues, or norm of antisymmetric component (J−J^T)/2), (2) a concrete and reproducible procedure to estimate it with occasional JVPs (including frequency, number of probes, and error bars), and (3) a careful correlation study with controls that vary noise (batch size), step size, and optimizer. For the downstream claim, specify the damping controller (what parameter is changed, how quickly, with hysteresis), and benchmark against strong baselines used for rotational/game dynamics (extragradient / optimistic methods) and standard GAN stabilizers. Report not just final FID but also stability metrics (divergence/collapse frequency), training curves, time-to-quality, and compute overhead, across multiple seeds. Include ablations (proxy type: cosine vs sign-flip vs random-projection sketch; smoothing windows; thresholds) and negative controls (cases with high noise but low rotation; synthetic games with tunable rotation) to avoid spurious correlations. Without these details and baselines, the novelty and the ‘no FID degradation’ claim are not currently justified."
