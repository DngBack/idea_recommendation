  "rationale": "This hypothesis is clearly defined and can be tested with lightweight measurements (gradient cosine/sign-flip) plus occasional Jacobian-vector products obtainable via standard autodiff, making it practical in a typical academic lab. It targets a well-motivated gap (cheap online rotation diagnostics) and can yield a publishable contribution even if the adaptive controller provides modest gains, because validating a reliable proxy and showing compute-aware benefits is valuable and broadly reusable.",
