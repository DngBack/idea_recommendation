  "Short Hypothesis": "A cheap proxy based on consecutive-step gradient disagreement (e.g., 1−cos(g_t,g_{t-1}) or sign-flip rate) will positively correlate with Jacobian-imaginary-dominance/rotation indicators (approximated via occasional Jacobian-vector products) and can be used to trigger adaptive damping that improves stability without degrading final FID.",
