  "Short Hypothesis": "A proxy based on successive stochastic gradients (e.g., negative cosine similarity between consecutive game gradients, or disagreement between lookahead and current gradients) will correlate strongly with a more direct but expensive rotation diagnostic (e.g., skew-symmetric component magnitude estimated via Jacobian–vector products) across training regimes and datasets.",
  "Related Work": "Auto-finalized when reflection rounds were exhausted. Synthesis based on gathered search results.",
  "Abstract": "This direction was auto-finalized when reflection rounds were exhausted. Please expand the abstract and experiments from the chosen hypothesis and literature review.",
  "Experiments": "Proposed experiments to be specified: replicate baseline, ablations, and main comparison. (Auto-finalized.)",
